## 🎯 Overview

The Ad Campaign Budget Pacer prevents budget overspending while maximizing ad delivery through:
- 📊 **Real-time budget tracking** with sub-millisecond latency
- 🎛️ **Multiple pacing algorithms** (EVEN, ASAP, FRONT_LOADED, ADAPTIVE)
- 🚨 **Circuit breaker protection** to prevent overspend
- ⚡ **10,000+ QPS** throughput capability
- 📈 **Real-time monitoring dashboard** with WebSocket updates

## 💡 Understanding the Problem

### 💵 What Are Ad Bids?

In digital advertising, when you open an app or website, an auction happens in milliseconds ⏱️:

```
User opens app → Ad space available → Auction (100ms) → Winner shows ad
```

**Example** 📱: When someone opens Uber, multiple companies bid to show ads:
- Lyft bids $1.50 to show "Switch to Lyft, save 20%"
- DoorDash bids $0.80 for food delivery ad
- Lyft wins, pays $1.50, their ad appears
- **All in <100 milliseconds!**

### 💸 The Budget Challenge

Without pacing, catastrophic overspend occurs 😱:
```
Campaign Budget: $10,000/day
Average bid: $1.50
Morning surge: 50,000 opportunities
Potential disaster: Spend $75,000 in 1 hour! 💸
```

Our pacer prevents this by intelligently controlling spend rate throughout the day. 🎯💰

## 🎯 How It Works - High Level

Think of this system as a **smart thermostat for money** 🌡️💵 - it monitors spending in real-time and adjusts the bid rate to maintain perfect pace throughout the day.

### ⚡ The Decision Flow (Under 10ms!)

```
1. RECEIVE (1ms): "User available, want to bid?"
2. CHECK (2ms): Budget left? Time remaining? Current pace?
3. DECIDE (2ms): Apply algorithm, check circuit breaker
4. RESPOND (1ms): "Yes, bid $1.50" or "No, skip"

Total: 6ms ✅ (Must be under 20ms or lose the auction!)
```

### 🌃 Real Example: Friday Night Campaign

```
6 PM: Starting
├── Budget: $10,000 for the day
├── Strategy: FRONT_LOADED
└── Status: Spending freely

8 PM: Peak Hours  
├── Spent: $7,000 (70%)
├── Requests: 5,000/second!
└── Action: Throttle 30% of bids

10 PM: Approaching Limit
├── Spent: $9,500 (95%)
├── Circuit breaker: TRIPS! 🚨
└── Action: STOP all bidding

10:05 PM: Recovery
├── State: HALF_OPEN (testing)
├── Action: Try 2 careful bids
└── Success: Resume at 90% throttle

Midnight: Day Ends
├── Final: $9,850 spent
├── Result: Under budget ✅
└── Reach: 2.5M impressions
```

## 🚦 Quick Start

### ✅ Prerequisites
- 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose
- 💾 4GB+ RAM available
- 🌐 Ports 80, 3000, 8000, 8080, 5432, 6379 available

### 1️⃣ Clone and Start Services

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ad-campaign-budget-pacer.git

- **📊 Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090

### 3️⃣ Create Your First Campaign

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/campaigns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "camp-001",
    "name": "Summer Sale Campaign",
    "daily_budget_cents": 1000000,
    "start_date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",

## ⚡ Why Speed Matters

The entire ad auction happens in 100ms:

```
Timeline:
0ms    - User opens app
30ms   - App requests ads
40ms   - Bidders notified simultaneously  
50ms   - YOUR DECISION DEADLINE ← Only 10-20ms to respond!
60ms   - Auction runs
100ms  - Ad appears

If you take 50ms: TIMEOUT = Lost opportunity = No ad shown
```

📈 At scale, slow responses compound:
- 10,000 requests/second
- 20ms extra per request = 200 hours of delay/day!
- Result: System collapse

## 🛡️ Circuit Breaker Pattern

Circuit breakers prevent budget disasters, like an electrical breaker prevents fires:

### 🚦 Three States

```
🟢 CLOSED (Normal)
├── All requests processed
├── Monitoring spend rate
└── System healthy

🔴 OPEN (Protection Mode)  
├── ALL requests blocked
├── Triggered at 95% budget
└── Protects from overspend

🟡 HALF_OPEN (Recovery Test)
├── Allow 2 test bids
├── If successful → CLOSED
└── If failed → OPEN
```

### 🛡️ Protection in Action

```
Without Circuit Breaker:
8:45 PM: Hit 95% ($9,500)
8:46 PM: Momentum → $10,500
8:47 PM: Can't stop → $11,200  
8:48 PM: Disaster → $12,000 (20% OVER!)

With Circuit Breaker:
8:45 PM: Hit 95% threshold
8:45 PM: INSTANT STOP ← Circuit trips
8:46 PM: All bids rejected
Final: $9,500 (Within budget ✅)
```

## 📊 Pacing Algorithms

### ⚖️ EVEN Pacing
⏰ Distributes budget evenly across 24 hours.
```
Target: daily_budget / 24 per hour
Throttle: Based on current hour's overspend
```

### 🏃 ASAP Pacing
💸 Spends budget as quickly as possible with safety margins.
```
Throttle rates:
- 95%+ spent: 90% throttle
- 90%+ spent: 50% throttle  
- 80%+ spent: 20% throttle
```

### 🌅 FRONT_LOADED Pacing
🌄 70% budget in first 12 hours, 30% in remaining.
```
Morning (0-12h): 70% of budget
Evening (12-24h): 30% of budget
```

### 🤖 ADAPTIVE Pacing
🤖 Machine learning-based optimization using historical patterns.
```
Uses hourly multipliers based on:
- Historical performance
- Day of week patterns
- Traffic predictions
```

## 📢 Understanding Campaigns

A **campaign** is an organized advertising effort with specific budget and goals:

### 📋 Example Campaign Structure
```json
{
  "id": "camp-summer-2024",
  "name": "Summer Ride Promotion",
  "daily_budget_cents": 1000000,  // $10,000/day
  "total_budget_cents": 30000000, // $300,000 total
  "targeting": {
    "apps_installed": ["uber"],
    "locations": ["San Francisco", "NYC"],
    "time_of_day": "commute_hours"
  },
  "pacing_mode": "FRONT_LOADED",  // 70% before noon
  "creative": "Get 20% off Lyft rides!"
}
```

### 🎯 Campaign Types

**🆕 Acquisition Campaign**: Get new users
```
Budget: $50,000/day
Target: Never used Lyft
Strategy: EVEN pacing
Goal: 1,000 new signups
```

**⚔️ Competitive Campaign**: Steal competitors' users  
```
Budget: $20,000/day
Target: Active Uber users
Strategy: FRONT_LOADED (morning commute)
Goal: Get switchers
```

**🔄 Retention Campaign**: Keep existing users
```
Budget: $5,000/day
Target: Inactive Lyft users
Strategy: ADAPTIVE (learned patterns)
Goal: Reactivation
```

## 🛡️ Circuit Breaker States

The circuit breaker prevents budget overspend through three states:

1. **CLOSED** (Normal Operation)
   - All requests processed normally
   - Monitoring spend percentage

2. **OPEN** (Protection Mode)
   - Triggered at 95% budget consumption
   - All bid requests blocked
   - Auto-recovery after 5 minutes

3. **HALF_OPEN** (Recovery Mode)
   - Limited requests allowed
   - Testing system recovery
   - Returns to CLOSED after 2 successful requests

## 🔥 Redis Failure Handling & Graceful Degradation

The system is designed to survive Redis outages without stopping ad delivery:

### 🔄 Multi-Level Fallback Strategy

```
Normal Operation (Redis Available):
├── Redis: Primary data store (sub-ms latency)
├── Memory Cache: 5-second TTL backup
└── Status: Full accuracy, maximum performance

Degraded Mode (Redis Down):
├── Memory Cache: Primary tracking
├── Conservative Defaults: Safety throttling
├── Recovery Queue: Tracks pending updates
└── Status: Reduced accuracy, but operational
```

### ⚙️ How Failover Works

1. **🔍 Detection** (< 1 second)
   - Health check pings Redis every 5 seconds
   - Failure detected after 2 consecutive timeouts
   - System enters degraded mode automatically

2. **⚠️ Degraded Operation**
   ```json
   // Normal response
   {
     "allow_bid": true,
     "throttle_rate": 0.15
   }
   
   // Degraded mode response
   {
     "allow_bid": true,
     "throttle_rate": 0.5,    // Conservative throttling
     "warning": "Operating in degraded mode"
   }
   ```

3. **🧠 In-Memory Tracking**
   - All spend updates stored in memory
   - Hourly/daily counters maintained locally
   - No data loss during outage

4. **🔄 Auto-Recovery** (Zero Manual Intervention)
   ```
   Every 10 seconds:
   ├── Check if Redis is back
   ├── If healthy: Sync memory → Redis
   ├── Clear recovery queue
   └── Resume normal operation
   ```

### 🧪 Testing Redis Failover

```bash
# 1. Simulate Redis failure
docker stop redis

# 2. Service continues (check health)
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Returns: {"status": "degraded", "redis_healthy": false}

# 3. Decisions still work (conservative mode)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pacing/decision \
  -d '{"campaign_id": "camp-001", "bid_cents": 100}'
# Returns decision with higher throttle rate

# 4. Restart Redis
docker start redis

# 5. Auto-recovery happens (wait 10 seconds)
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Returns: {"status": "healthy", "redis_healthy": true}
```

### ⚠️ What Happens During Redis Outage

| Feature | Normal Mode | Degraded Mode |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Bid Decisions | Full accuracy | Conservative (50-70% throttle) |
| Spend Tracking | Redis counters | Memory cache |
| Latency | < 5ms | < 3ms (faster!) |
| Budget Safety | Circuit breakers | Extra safety margin |
| Data Persistence | Immediate | Queued for recovery |

### 🔧 Recovery Process

When Redis returns:

1. **🔄 Sync Phase** (< 1 second)
   ```go
   // Accumulated memory data
   Memory: {camp-001: $1,250 spent during outage}
          {camp-002: $800 spent during outage}
   
   // Synced to Redis
   Redis: SET budget:day:camp-001:2024-01-15 = previous + $1,250
          SET budget:day:camp-002:2024-01-15 = previous + $800
   ```

2. **✅ Verification**
   - Confirm Redis writes successful
   - Clear recovery queue
   - Log recovery metrics

3. **🚀 Resume Normal Operations**
   - Disable conservative throttling
   - Switch back to Redis as primary
   - Remove degraded warnings

### 💡 Why This Matters

**❌ Without Graceful Degradation:**
- Redis fails → Service returns 500 errors
- Ad platform stops sending traffic
- Complete revenue loss
- Manual intervention required
- Recovery takes hours

**✅ With Graceful Degradation:**
- Redis fails → Service continues
- Conservative pacing protects budgets
- Minimal revenue impact
- Automatic recovery in seconds
- No manual intervention

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/campaigns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test-cb-001",
    "name": "Circuit Breaker Test",
    "daily_budget_cents": 1000,
    "pacing_mode": "ASAP"
  }'

# Rapidly spend budget
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/spend/track \
    -d '{"campaign_id":"test-cb-001","spend_cents":50}'
done

1. **Services not starting:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   docker-compose logs [service-name]
   ```

2. **High latency:**
   ```bash
   # Check Redis performance
   docker exec budget-pacer-redis redis-cli --latency
   
   # Check database connections
   docker exec budget-pacer-postgres pg_isready
   ```

3. **Circuit breaker issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check circuit breaker metrics
   curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep circuit
   
   # Review threshold settings
   grep budgetThreshold pacer-service/pacer/circuitbreaker.go
   ```

4. **Memory issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check container resources
   docker stats
   
   # Increase memory limits if needed
   docker-compose down
   # Edit docker-compose.yml memory limits
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## 🧪 Load Testing

Run performance tests:

```bash
# Setup test campaigns
python scripts/load-test.py --setup --campaigns 100

# Run normal traffic pattern (100 QPS for 60s)
python scripts/load-test.py --qps 100 --duration 60 --pattern normal

# Run surge test (1000 QPS)
python scripts/load-test.py --qps 1000 --duration 30 --pattern surge

# Test circuit breakers
python scripts/load-test.py --qps 500 --pattern circuit_breaker_test
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pacer-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pacer
        image: ad-pacer:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "1000m"
```

### 🏛️ High Availability Setup

1. **Redis Cluster**: Use Redis Sentinel for HA
2. **PostgreSQL**: Configure streaming replication
3. **Load Balancer**: Use HAProxy or AWS ALB
4. **Auto-scaling**: Configure HPA based on CPU/latency
