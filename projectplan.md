# Ad Campaign Budget Pacer - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a production-ready Ad Campaign Budget Pacer service that intelligently distributes campaign budgets throughout the day with real-time tracking, predictive pacing algorithms, and circuit breakers.

## Technical Architecture
- **Core Service**: Go (high-performance pacing decisions, target: 10k+ QPS)
- **API Layer**: Python/FastAPI (management endpoints)
- **Storage**: Redis (real-time counters), PostgreSQL (configuration & history)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
- [x] Create project plan
- [ ] Set up project directory structure
- [ ] Initialize configuration files (docker-compose.yml, Makefile)
- [ ] Create .gitignore and README scaffold

### Phase 2: Database Layer
- [ ] Design PostgreSQL schema for campaigns, pacing configs, spend tracking
- [ ] Create initialization SQL scripts
- [ ] Set up Redis configuration for real-time counters
- [ ] Define data models and indexes

### Phase 3: Core Pacing Service (Go)
- [ ] Initialize Go module and dependencies
- [ ] Implement budget tracker with Redis integration
- [ ] Create pacing algorithms (EVEN, ASAP, FRONT_LOADED, ADAPTIVE)
- [ ] Build circuit breaker system
- [ ] Implement high-performance REST API endpoints
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics collection

### Phase 4: Management API (Python/FastAPI)
- [ ] Set up FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Implement campaign CRUD operations
- [ ] Create budget management endpoints
- [ ] Add historical performance queries
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Dashboard
- [ ] Create real-time HTML/JavaScript dashboard
- [ ] Configure Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Implement alert rules

### Phase 6: Testing & Performance
- [ ] Write unit tests for pacing algorithms
- [ ] Create load testing scripts
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Complete README with architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create deployment guide
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Key Design Decisions

### Pacing Algorithm Strategy
- **EVEN**: Linear distribution across time windows
- **ASAP**: Maximize early spend with safety margins
- **FRONT_LOADED**: 70/30 split for morning/afternoon
- **ADAPTIVE**: ML-based using historical patterns

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
- Three states: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
- Trip threshold: 95% budget consumed
- Auto-reset after 5-minute cooldown
- Gradual recovery in HALF_OPEN state

### Performance Targets
- Pacing decision latency: <10ms p99
- Spend tracking latency: <5ms p99
- Throughput: 10,000+ QPS per instance
- Memory usage: <100MB for 1000 campaigns

### Data Storage Strategy
- Redis: Real-time counters with 24-hour TTL
- PostgreSQL: Configuration and historical data
- Async logging to prevent blocking operations
- Connection pooling for both databases

## Success Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: 95%+ pacing accuracy
2. **Performance**: Sub-10ms decision latency
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
4. **Scale**: Handle 10k+ QPS
5. **Observability**: Complete metrics coverage

## Review Section
